# AlphaNet

We present **AlphaNet**, a local frame-based equivariant model designed to tackle the challenges of achieving both accurate and efficient simulations for atomistic systems.  **AlphaNet** enhances computational efficiency and accuracy by leveraging the local geometric structures of atomic environments through the construction of equivariant local frames and learnable frame transitions. Notably, AlphaNet offers one of the best trade-offs between computational efficiency and accuracy among existing models. Moreover, AlphaNet exhibits scalability across a broad spectrum of system and dataset sizes, affirming its versatility.

## Installation Guide

### Installation Steps

1. **Create a Conda Environment**

   Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

   ```bash
   conda create -n alphanet_env python=3.8 #or later version
   ```

2. **Activate the Environment**

   ```bash
   conda activate alphanet_env
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**

   Navigate to your desired installation directory and run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AlphaNet.git
   ```

5. **Install AlphaNet**

   Navigate into the cloned repository and install AlphaNet in editable mode:

   ```bash
   cd AlphaNet
   pip install -e .
   ```

   This allows you to make changes to the codebase and have them reflected without reinstalling the package.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage


Our code is based on pytorch-lightning, you can try a quick run by:

```bash 
python mul_train.py
```

To prepare dataset in format of pickle, you can use:

1. from deepmd:

```bash 
python scripts/dp2pic_batch.py
```

2. from extxyz:

```bash 
python scripts/xyz2pic.py
```

To convert lightning formatted checkpoint to common state dict file:

```bash 
python scripts/pl2ckpt.py
```

Once you have a converted checkpoint, you can evaluate it and plot it out:

```bash 
python test.py --config path/to/config --ckpt path/to/ckpt
```
There is also an ase calculator:

```python 
from alpnanet.infer.calc import AlphaNetCalculator
```

## Pretrained Models

The models pretrained on OC2M and MPtrj are nearly ready for release, so you wonâ€™t have to wait much longer. Additionally, we are actively planning the release of other pretrained models in the near future.
